This file contains a typical question and my solution based on digital electronics.
It represents a system that can be used to control a lighting system using three binary inputs.
The solution is derived using a combination of truth tables and Karnaugh maps, and the final circuit is simulated in Proteus.
FOR PROTEUS DESIGN CIRCUITRY I ONLY USED LOGIC GATES AND NOTHING SPECIAL.
The project is running smoothly
